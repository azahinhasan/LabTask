                    it down the middle.
                    It is an island filled with Creatures, and surrounded by water on all sides, with hazardous cliffs

                <p>World's Edge is a map introduced in Season 3.svg Season 3 located on the planet Talos.The once
                    uninhabitable world of Talos became a hotbed of IMC activity when a rare mineral compound was
                    discovered
                    beneath its surface. Heat-reducing towers were built to super-cool its natural lava flows, and the
                    town of World’s Edge
                    grew around them. Decades ago, an explosion in one of the towers covered the surrounding area in a
                    lethal flash freeze.
                    Today, World’s Edge is deserted, its borders inhabited by a small community of hunters who
                    reportedly spurn modern
                    technology.

                    After the Repulsor attack on King's Canyon and the various attempts to rebuild it proved too much
                    trouble than they were
                    worth, the games were moved to World's Edge.</p>
