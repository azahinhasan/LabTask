        Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale game developed by <span style="color: #DDB477;">Entertainment and
            published by
            Electronic
            Arts.</span>
        ... In Apex Legends, up to 20 three-person squads land on an island and search for weapons and supplies
        before
        attempting to defeat all other players in combat.
        A Nintendo Switch version is planned for release in late 2020, along with cross-platform play between all
        supported
        platforms.[1]

        In Apex Legends, up to 20 three-person squads land on an island and search for weapons and supplies before
        attempting to
        defeat all other players in combat. The available play area on the island shrinks over time, forcing players to
        keep
        moving or else find themselves outside the play area which can be fatal. The final team alive wins the round.
        The game
        is set in the same science fiction universe as Respawn Entertainment's Titanfall and Titanfall 2.[2]

        Work on the game began sometime around late 2016 and early 2017, though the project remained a secret right up
        until its
        launch. The game's release in 2019 came as a surprise, as until that point it had been assumed that Respawn
        Entertainment was working on a third installment to the Titanfall franchise, the studio's previous major title.

        Apex Legends received positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay, progression system, and fusion of
        elements from various genres. Some considered it a worthy competitor to Fortnite Battle Royale, a similar game
        that had
        gained massive popularity in the previous year. Apex Legends surpassed over 25 million players by the end of its
        first
        week, and 50 million within its first month. According to EA, as of July 2019, the game had approximately 8 to
        10
        million players a week and by October 2019 it had approximately 70 million players worldwide.
